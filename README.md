# pdf_to_booklet

Run the main.py code first, edit in the main.py to add file name/location


Still work in progress
- need to add in function to convert pdf into segments to rearrange ex:
      - 4 pages on 1 sheet
      - 4 pages to one section
      - so, a 96 page pdf would have 6 sections of 4 sheets, with 4 pages each. That would be 16 total pages for 4 sheets of paper
      - should take in user input
      
- need to workout how to fix order of pages that the final pdf is in, make it automated

- once the backbone is working, create a simple gui
